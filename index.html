In general, this race is great for grinding, PvP against Teamers and especially breaking combos. Additionally, it is also good for Instinct-Breaking and doing combos with Instinct-Trickable attacks.

It has a 12.5% chance to be granted upon first joining    This race largely relies on its potential to delay time in battles, providing the player with common abilities such as healing and improved jumping capabilities. The aforementioned buffs are considered by many to be easy to counter, but in return, its V4 can be effective against all races, not purely because of its powerful abilities, but thanks to the ability to break combos (this makes it even more dangerous when the player just needs to fly a long distance and then heal) and the huge damage it is capable of dealing. In general, this race is only dangerous when V4 is activated, and it is recommended to run away/avoid fighting if it is not available (or when at low health). The player should make sure to fill their transformation meter as quickly as possible, especially prior to engaging in PvP.",

However, it does not grant immunity to Electric Claw, Pole (1st Form) and Pole (2nd Form), even though they are electric-based forms of attack. Rubber is good for grinding because of its long ranged M1s.Rubber is good until the player reaches Upper Skylands since most NPCs have ranged attacks and the fruit needs a lot of accuracy. It is still, to a degree, a better option for grinding, than most 'regular' Blox Fruits.",
    "whatislight": "Light is a Rare Elemental-type Blox Fruit that costs MoneyIcon 650,000 or RobuxIcon 1,100 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.Light is considered to be one of the best grinding fruits in First Sea since it is an Elemental Blox Fruit and has AoE moves, decent damage, relatively low mastery requirements, M1s, and one of the fastest movement abilities in the game. However, awakened Buddha or awakened Magma are more recommended in the Second Sea and Third Sea, unless the player is experienced with grinding and can awaken this fruit, due to the high level requirements in order to activate Elemental immunity. Its Awakened version is a great choice for PvP due to its good stuns, decent range, good combo potential, and high damage.",

It doesn't require much mastery, meaning First Sea players can grind with the unawakened version of it easily. It is also good for Second Sea and Third Sea as it is excellent for Sea Events like the Leviathan, Sea Beast and Ship Raids. Being the highest damaging fruit allows it to be able to solo easy raids like Flame, Dark, and others. This fruit is currently the most expensive rare fruit in the game.",
    "whatisbarrier": "Barrier is a Rare Natural-type Blox Fruit that costs MoneyIcon 800,000 or RobuxIcon 1,250 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.Barrier is decent for Raids, since the user can block enemies with [Z] Barrier Wall, letting their teammates damage the NPCs or Bosses without taking damage. However, it can be underwhelming if used elsewhere. This fruit is really useful for trolling as the user can block other player’s path, such as blocking the entrance of Mansion at Floating Turtle, Portal [V] Exit, Cursed Ship, etc. But this fruit is one of the worst fruits for PVP and grinding.",
    "whatisghost": "Ghost (formerly known as Revive) is a Rare Natural-type Blox Fruit that costs MoneyIcon 940,000 or RobuxIcon 1,275 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.Ghost has unique skills controlled from the dead and it gives the user good mobility and a strong passive which is 'Resurrection', which gives the player a second life after dying with half health, meaning that the player can play more offensively as it allows them to survive most of the combos.",

While transformed, the user can deal continuous damage by holding [F], and its M1 attack includes a roar that can hit Sea Beasts, making it a moderate choice for hunting Sea Events when using the Shark race.Mammoth is a decent fruit for PvP, since it has a long movement ability when untransformed and an infinitely damaging move when in transformed mode, but it is advised to use other fruits to aid in combat because of its slow movesets",
    "whatistrex": "T-Rex is a Mythical Beast-type Blox Fruit that costs MoneyIcon 2,700,000 or RobuxIcon 2,350 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.T-Rex allows the user to transform into a Tyrannosaurus Rex, commonly abbreviated as T-Rex.T-Rex has a relatively high demand in trading for its good farming potential, an amazing PvP performance and M1 ability. Although there are no mastery requirements for the tap (M1) move, casual First and early Second Sea players will only have 1-2 skills unlocked due to this fruit's high mastery levels. For that reason, it is recommended to eat after mid to late game.",
    "whatisdough": "Dough is a Mythical Elemental-type Blox Fruit that costs MoneyIcon 2,800,000 or RobuxIcon 2,400 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.Dough has incredible PvP potential and moderate grinding capabilities when awakened, having great stuns, Instinct break, and great damage on almost every move, making it simultaneously gain an incredibly high value in trading.

Most of these weapons have a focus on precise, close ranged moves.All swords have two unique abilities, and some swords have imbued or skills that originate from their Blox Fruit counterpart (or from somewhere else).All swords can also be upgraded, via the Blacksmith NPC and Enchanted via the Dragon Talon Sage, to deal extra damage and to gain unique abilities relative to the sword.All swords and their abilities cannot harm Chop users due to their passive immunity to swords, even if they use Aura.
